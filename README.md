# Crypto Tracker Site


### link to site: https://crypto-tracker-site.reflex.run/

A site built in [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) that uses the [coinlore.com](https://www.coinlore.com/) api for getting info about 100+ coins and converting them to USD. 



### Self hosting:
To self host and for development you need python 3.11 or above[^1] 

in terminal, navigate to the `crypto_tracker_site` folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

to run just write `python -m reflex run` in the command line



[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
